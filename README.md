## Network-Anomaly-Detection
# Project Overview
In modern day cybersecurity landscape, signature-based detection is no longer effective to stop Zero-day DDoS attacks. This project implements a **proactive,anomaly-based detection framework** that learns to identify the "DNA" or the basis of normal network traffic and flags deviations as potential threats. I have developed and compared four distinct machine learning models to determine the most effective balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency, ranging from **Deep Learning Autoencoders** to **Ensemble Tree methods**
